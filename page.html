    <b><pre>
    I'm happy that you're my teacher;
I enjoy each lesson you teach.
As my role model you inspire me

With your kindness you get my attention;
Every day you are planting a seed
Of curiosity and motivation
To know and to grow and succeed.

I'm thankful for all that you've done.
I admire you each day, and I just want to say,
As a teacher, you're number one!
